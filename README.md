# Webcam Classifier
This is a Python machine learning application which can classify 2 objects. This project uses the following libraries:
- Tkinter for a simple GUI
- CV2 or OpenCV to handle images for training and predicting
- PIL or Pillow for processing images
- SKLearn for the machine learning model

This project uses LinearSVC as the machine learning model for training and predicting. This can be changed to another model as well.
