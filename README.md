# Webcam Classifier
This is a Python machine learning application which can classify 2 objects. This project uses the following libraries:
- Tkinter for a simple GUI
- CV2 or OpenCV to handle images for training and predicting
- PIL or Pillow for processing images
- SKLearn for the machine learning model
- Numpy

This project uses LinearSVC as the machine learning model for training and predicting. This can be changed to another model as well.
It uses the computer's webcam to capture images for training and also for predicting.

To use this application on your machine, you would need to install the required libraries stated above and then run the 'main.py' script.
